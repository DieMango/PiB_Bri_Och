problem: agents dont update their directions properly

getting function for shortest path to taskboard/ dispenser/ goalzone to work properly
	
connect blocks
-> after getting their blocks agents move to each other
	connect blocks
	move together to goalzone?
	
	idea: agent 1(who submits the task) stops when in sight with partner
		agent 2 moves in position to connect his block
		1) block needs to go left/right 
			-> agent 2 moves left/right next to agent 1 and rotates his block ccs/cs till facing south
			(problem: block is attached left/right to agent 2/agent1)
		2)block needs to go south 
			->?

movement!
	avoid obstacles, agents and blocks
		->rotation
		
failsave for disconnects?


PVP:
tasks:
	if an agent has a already sumbitted task, it should drop it



DONE:

tasks: erst linker dann rechter block
-> block unter agent mit task immer block 1

implementing a function to find the shortest distance to POIs
